## 📂 Portfolio Projects

### 1. [Central America Education Trends Dashboard](#)
*Tools: Tableau, R, Python, World Bank Education & Development Indicators*  
This project started with a massive dataset: the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. It included hundreds of variables across dozens of countries and years. My first challenge was to **clean and reshape the data** so it could be used for meaningful analysis.  

I focused on Central America and pulled out education-related measures like literacy rates, school completion, government spending, internet usage, and poverty levels. The data was messy — with gaps, inconsistent formats, and multiple levels of granularity — so I spent significant time standardizing, filtering, and making sure comparisons were accurate.  

The final Tableau dashboard brings those cleaned datasets together in one place, making it easy to:  
- Track how literacy and completion rates vary across countries.  
- Compare education outcomes with poverty and internet access.  
- See how government spending connects to long-term trends.  

The goal was to turn a sprawling dataset into a **clear, interactive story** about education and opportunity in Central America.

### 2. [NBA Salaries Analysis](#)
*Tools: SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), R*  
I wanted to answer a simple but interesting question: *what really drives NBA player salaries?*  

I started by cleaning and organizing player stats, then ran correlation analysis in SQL and Python. I built visualizations to see how performance metrics lined up with pay, and what we could predict about future pay.  

Key findings included:  
- Salaries were most strongly tied to **minutes per game, assists, turnovers, fouls, and points**.  
- Some players stood out as outliers — earning high salaries with limited playing time, or delivering strong performance for much less money.  

This project was a great mix of technical and storytelling skills. It shows how raw stats can become insights about value, equity, and decision-making in professional sports.

### 3. [Food Insecurity in Chicago](#)
*Tools: Excel, Tableau, R, Python, USDA, Economic Research Service*  
This project explores the reality of food insecurity in Chicago using publicly available data.  
I cleaned and analyzed datasets from the USDA Economic Research Service to look at patterns across neighborhoods, income levels, and demographics.  

The interactive dashboard highlights:  
- Which communities experience the highest levels of food insecurity.  
- How income, employment, and access to grocery stores connect to food availability.  
- Trends over time and which groups are most at risk.  

The goal of this project was not just to crunch numbers but to tell a story about equity and access — and to show how data can help identify where policy and resources are most needed.
